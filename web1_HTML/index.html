    <h2>World Wide Web</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" title="WWW 설명 사이트">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    <br>(URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
    <br>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
    <br>The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.</p>
